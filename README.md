# Virtual-Cafe
Simulating a Cafe experience using a Client-Server Architecture and Socket Programming.


## Objective


Each client application will play the role of a Customer who wants to order tea or coffee. The server application will play the role of the caf√©'s virtual Barista, who processes the orders, prepares tea and coffee, and delivers orders back to the customers.

### Features of Customer

- Placing Orders: Customer can type commands in the terminal to order tea or coffee, specifying the quantity and type of beverage. See commands.txt

- Order Status Inquiry: Customer can inquire about the status of their order at any time. See commands.txt

- Leaving the Cafe: Customer can leave the cafe at any time. See commands.txt


### Features of Barista
- Barista Processes and Responds to Customer Orders.
- Barista returns status of an order.
- Barista handles inappropraite Customer Requests.



### Usage and Installation

To run the Virtual Cafe application locally, follow these steps:

- Clone this Repository.

```bash 
 javac -cp "." Barista.java

## Improvements

- Extend Identification of Customers using an ID

- Barista contains a Brewing Area, Tray Area and Waiting Area. Alternative design decisions are welcome.
